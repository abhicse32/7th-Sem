1. ackermann.asm contain the implementaion of question. 1

2. flcpy contains the implementaion of question. 2

3. change present working directory to the one containing the above two programs

4. type ./compile on console to compile both programs

5. to run ackermann function type ./ackermann

6. to run filecopy program type ./flcpy 

note:
	to manually compile the two programs separately, follow the following steps:

for question 1:
	nasm -f elf ackermann.asm -o objectfile.o
	gcc  -o executablename objectfile.o
to run:
  type ./executablename


question -2.
       nasm -f elf flcpy.asm  -o objectfile.o
	   ld  -o executablename  objectfile.o
